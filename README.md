# Linkedin Scraper for Employment and School History
Program to scrape the names of every Berkeley J-School grad on LinkedIn, as well as related data. Can be easily modified to search for employees from nearly any organization.

Not all of the code here is unique to me-- I drew in part on this tutorial (https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/how-easy-scraping-data-from-linkedin-profiles-david-craven/) from David Craven.
