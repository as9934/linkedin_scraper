# linkedin_scraper
Program to scrape the names of every Berkeley J-School grad on LinkedIn, as well as reated data. 

Not all of the code here is unique to me-- I drew heavily on this tutorial (https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/how-easy-scraping-data-from-linkedin-profiles-david-craven/) from David Craven.
